This repository is the PyTorch implementation of our DocRE model with coreference resolution in arxiv Paper "Coref-aware Document-Level Relation Extraction".

> Document-level relation extraction is to extract relation facts from a document consisting of multiple sentences, in which pronoun crossed sentences is ubiquitous phenomenon. In this paper, we imitate the humanâ€™s reading process by leveraging the coreference information when construct heterogeneous graph to enhance the semantic information. Since the pronoun is notoriously ambiguous in graph, a mention-pronoun coreference resolution is introduced to calculate the affinity between pronouns and corresponding mentions, and noise suppression mechanism is proposed to reduce the noise caused by pronouns. Experiments on the public dataset, DocRED, show that Coref-aware Doc-level Relation Extraction based on Graph Inference Network(CorefDRE) outperforms the state-of-the-art baselines.
